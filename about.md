Hi there! I'm Renaud. I'm an ops guy.
I sometimes write about it. But my posts mainly talk about one of my other interests which currently include: Ruby, Kanban, open source, translation, strength training and (american) football.
When I write code, I usually put it on [GitHub](https://github.com/karouf), where I also try to help with some existing open source projects.
If you want to contact me, just shoot me an [email](mailto:hi@renaudmarti.net) or find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/karouf).
