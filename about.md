Hi there! I'm Renaud. I'm an ops guy.
I sometimes write about it. But my posts mainly talk about one of my other interests: Ruby, Kanban, open source, translation, strength training and (american) football.
When I write code, I usually put it on [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}), where I also try to help with some existing open source projects.
If you want to contact me, just shoot me an [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}).
