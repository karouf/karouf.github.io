## My way to the OSCP

- why the OSCP
	- I want a pentest cert because not much professional experience
	- known to be hard: good reputation and I like the challenge
    - hands on: you get practical knowledge and i think it's more ingrained that way
    - THE LAB!!!!
- goals for my training
    - looking at things differently, thinking outside the box
    - train my thought process to achieve that quickly and in realistic scenarii
	- train my tech skills, learn new ones
	- build tools that I can use during the PWK course and OSCP exam
- plan
	- Root-Me challenges: set a goal, number of points, level, % complete?
	- Kioptrix VMs, same series increasig difficulty
	- Different VMs from Vulnhub, list from Medium
	- CTFs, online and at confs
