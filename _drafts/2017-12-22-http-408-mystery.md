i ran into a tricky problem the other day at $WORK and thought it would be a good idea to share it here, if at least to make a note of it for later.
We had some devices on a client's network that wouldn't connect back to our servers anymore. As always in this case, nobody changed anything anywhere but it stopped working nonetheless.
Anyway, looking at our logs I noticed some weird HTTP 408 errors. First time I saw that so I went looking for an explanation on the Internets: turns out it indicates that a client initiated a TCP connection to the server but didn't send HTTP traffic afterwards before the server timeout kicked in.
On Apache, this timeout is set by default to 20s. I captured some traffic with tcpdump to check what was happening and indeed the TCP connection was closed by the server after 20s.
At that point I should point that our devices connect over HTTPS. I got the logs from one of those devices and found that on its side the connection failed because it couldn't negociate the TLS session: there was a certificate error. Weird because we make sure to embed our TLS certs in the devices themselves.
