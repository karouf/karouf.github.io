New to this whole devops thing? There are a lot of community resources out there where
people interact and that you can learn from.
Here is a list of some of them.

Devops forums:

* [Devops sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/)
* [General devops forum at Spiceworks](https://community.spiceworks.com/devops/general)
* [DevopsIO](http://discuss.devopsio.com/)

Less specialized forums:
